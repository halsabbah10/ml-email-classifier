## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

### Machine Learning Model Architecture

The email classification system is built using scikit-learn and implements a text processing pipeline combined with Support Vector Machine classification. This approach was chosen for its reliability and performance on text classification tasks.

#### Algorithm Selection: Linear SVM vs Naive Bayes
Initially, I implemented the system using Multinomial Naive Bayes, which is commonly recommended for text classification tasks. However, after testing and evaluation, I migrated to **Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC)** for the following reasons:

1. **Improved accuracy**: LinearSVC achieved 3-5% better performance on the test dataset
2. **Better handling of high-dimensional features**: SVM performs well with the large feature space typical in text classification
3. **More consistent results**: LinearSVC showed more stable performance across different text patterns
4. **Suitable for limited datasets**: Given the constraints of the training data size, SVM proved more reliable

#### Pipeline Implementation

The model uses a scikit-learn Pipeline combining TF-IDF vectorization with LinearSVC:

```python
Pipeline([
    ('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer(
        max_features=5000,          # Limit vocabulary size to prevent overfitting
        ngram_range=(1, 2),         # Include unigrams and bigrams for context
        min_df=2,                   # Remove terms appearing in fewer than 2 documents
        max_df=0.95,                # Remove terms appearing in more than 95% of documents
        stop_words='english',       # Filter out common English stop words
        sublinear_tf=False,         # Use linear term frequency scaling
        use_idf=True                # Apply inverse document frequency weighting
    )),
    ('clf', LinearSVC(
        C=1.0,                      # Regularization parameter (optimized through testing)
        random_state=42,            # Ensure reproducible results
        max_iter=3000,              # Maximum iterations for convergence
        class_weight='balanced'     # Handle class imbalance automatically
    ))
])
```

#### Training Process

1. **Data preparation**: Customer support emails were collected and manually labeled across 4 categories
2. **Text preprocessing**:
   - Email subject and body are combined into a single text input for richer context
   - TF-IDF vectorization converts text into numerical features suitable for machine learning
   - N-gram range (1,2) captures both individual words and two-word combinations
   - English stop words and rare/common terms are filtered to reduce noise

3. **Feature engineering decisions**:
   - **Vocabulary size**: Limited to 5000 features based on performance testing to balance accuracy and efficiency
   - **N-gram combinations**: Bigrams like "payment failed" provide important contextual information
   - **Class balancing**: Ensures equal treatment of categories regardless of training sample distribution

4. **Model training**:
   - Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the regularization parameter
   - Balanced class weights address potential imbalances in the training data
   - Training iterations were set high enough to ensure proper convergence

### Model Performance

- **Algorithm**: TF-IDF Vectorization + Linear Support Vector Classifier
- **Accuracy**: 97.1% on test set
- **Training Time**: < 2 seconds on modern hardware
- **Prediction Time**: < 50ms per email

### Classification Categories

| Category | Keywords/Patterns | Confidence |
|----------|------------------|------------|
| Billing Issue | invoice, payment, charge, refund, subscription | 99.8%+ |
| Technical Support | error, bug, crash, login, not working | 88.0%+ |
| Feedback | great, love, suggestion, improve, recommendation | 97.9%+ |
| Other | partnership, inquiry, general questions | 99.0%+ |

### Technical Considerations & Limitations

While the model achieves 97.1% accuracy, there are several technical limitations inherent to the current architecture:

#### 1. **Training Dataset Constraints**
- **Limitation**: The model is trained on a finite dataset, which may not cover all possible email variations
- **Impact**: Performance may vary on emails with uncommon patterns or highly specialized terminology

#### 2. **Probability Estimation**
- **Limitation**: LinearSVC doesn't provide well-calibrated probability estimates by default
- **Impact**: Confidence scores should be interpreted as relative rankings rather than absolute probabilities

#### 3. **Feature Engineering Approach**
- **Limitation**: TF-IDF parameters are manually optimized (max_features=5000, ngram_range=(1,2))
- **Impact**: Feature selection is based on statistical frequency rather than semantic importance

#### 4. **Text Processing Method**
- **Limitation**: Uses bag-of-words approach which doesn't capture semantic relationships or context
- **Impact**: May struggle with emails where word order or semantic meaning is crucial for classification

#### 5. **Single-label Classification**
- **Limitation**: Each email is assigned to exactly one category
- **Impact**: Cannot handle emails that span multiple categories (e.g., billing issues with technical components)

#### 6. **Language Specificity**
- **Limitation**: Optimized specifically for English text with English stop words
- **Impact**: Not suitable for multilingual email processing without modification

#### 7. **Static Model**
- **Limitation**: Model parameters are fixed after training
- **Impact**: Cannot adapt to evolving email patterns without retraining
